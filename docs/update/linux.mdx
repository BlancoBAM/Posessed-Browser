# Updating on Linux

## Lilith Linux

Posessed Browser is included in the **official Lilith Linux repositories**, so installing system updates also delivers browser updates:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade
```

This is the recommended update path for Lilith Linux users. Posessed Browser can also update independently — new releases are published to [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser/releases) separately.

## AppImage

1. Download the latest `Posessed-Browser.AppImage` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser/releases)
2. Replace your existing AppImage file
3. Make it executable: `chmod +x Posessed-Browser.AppImage`
4. Relaunch

## Checking Your Version

Navigate to `chrome://settings/help` in Posessed Browser.
