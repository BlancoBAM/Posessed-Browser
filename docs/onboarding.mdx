## On Lilith Linux

Posessed Browser is your **default browser** on Lilith Linux — it's already installed and [Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim) is pre-configured as the AI backend.

Open the browser and click the **Assistant** button in the toolbar. That's it — no setup needed.

## What to Try First

Here are some things to try once you're set up:

- **Summarize a page** — Open any article and ask "Summarize this"
- **Fill a form** — Navigate to a form and ask the agent to fill it in
- **Extract data** — Ask the agent to scrape a table into a list
- **Automate a workflow** — Describe a multi-step task (e.g., "Search Google for X, open the first 3 results, summarize them")

<Info>
  **Lilith Linux users**: As Lilim is updated, your browser's AI capabilities
  automatically improve. Future Lilim releases will bring faster inference,
  better reasoning, and deeper system integration — no configuration required.
