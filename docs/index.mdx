# Let Lilim posess your browser.

**Posessed Browser** is an open-source, AI-native Chromium fork — built for and bundled with [Lilith Linux](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilith-Linux). It ships with [Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim) as the default AI brain, running entirely on your machine.

No cloud. No subscriptions. No surveillance.

## Lilim — Your Default AI

[Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim) is the intelligent AI system built for Lilith Linux. When you run Posessed Browser on Lilith Linux, Lilim handles everything — no API keys, no internet required, no data leaving your machine.

  improve — expect smarter agents, faster responses, and deeper system
  integration with every update.
