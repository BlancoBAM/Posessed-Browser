# Ad Blocking

Posessed Browser ships with a built-in ad blocker powered by uBlock Origin — one of the most effective blockers available. Unlike Chrome, which is phasing out Manifest V2 extensions, Posessed Browser keeps MV2 support fully enabled.

## What's Blocked

- Display ads and banners
- Video pre-roll and mid-roll ads
- Tracking scripts and pixels
- Third-party analytics
- Pop-ups and overlays
- Cookie consent banners (optional)

## Why It's Better Than Chrome

| Feature             | Chrome  | Posessed Browser |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| uBlock Origin (MV3) | Limited | Full             |
| uBlock Origin (MV2) | Blocked | ✅ Supported     |
| Native ad blocking  | ❌      | ✅ Built-in      |
| Filter list updates | Manual  | Automatic        |

## Configuration

Go to **Settings → Ad Blocker** to:

- Enable/disable blocking globally or per site
- Add custom filter rules
- Whitelist trusted sites
- Choose filter lists (EasyList, uBlock filters, etc.)

## Extensions

Because Posessed Browser supports Manifest V2, you can also install any Chrome extension from the Chrome Web Store — including the full version of uBlock Origin as a bonus layer.
