# Connect MCP Apps

Model Context Protocol (MCP) lets Posessed Browser connect to external tools and services — giving the AI agent access to your calendar, email, docs, and more.

## What is MCP?

MCP is an open standard that allows AI models to interact with external systems in a structured way. Connecting an MCP server gives the Posessed Browser agent access to that service's tools.

## Built-in MCP Tools

Posessed Browser ships with a built-in MCP server that exposes **31 browser automation tools** — controlling tabs, navigating, clicking, extracting content, running scripts, and more.

## Connecting an MCP App

1. Go to **Settings → App Connector**
2. Click **Add App**
3. Browse the available MCP servers or enter a custom server URL
4. Follow the app's authentication flow
5. The agent now has access to that service's tools

## Popular MCP Integrations

| App                | What it gives the agent  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Google Calendar    | Read/create/edit events  |
| Gmail              | Read and send emails     |
| Google Docs/Sheets | Read and write documents |
| Notion             | Query and update pages   |
| Custom MCP server  | Anything you build       |

## Posessed Browser as an MCP Server

You can also control Posessed Browser _from_ external tools. Configure it as an MCP server in your AI client:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "posessed-browser": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@browseros/mcp-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

This exposes your browser to `claude-code`, `gemini-cli`, or any MCP-compatible client as a set of 31 browser control tools.

## On Lilith Linux

[Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim)'s tool system integrates directly with MCP — future releases will expand native MCP support within the Lilith Linux ecosystem.
