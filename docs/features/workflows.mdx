# Agent Mode

Agent Mode lets you describe any web task in plain English and watch Posessed Browser execute it — clicking, typing, navigating, extracting data, filling forms.

On [Lilith Linux](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilith-Linux), the agent is powered by **[Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim)** — no setup required.

## How to Use

1. Open any webpage
2. Click the **Assistant** button in the toolbar (or press `Ctrl+B`)
3. Switch to **Agent Mode**
4. Describe what you want done in plain English
5. Watch the agent work

## Example Tasks

- _"Search Google for the top 5 AI tools released this week and summarize them"_
- _"Go to amazon.com and find the cheapest USB-C hub with 4+ stars"_
- _"Fill out this form with my address: 123 Main St..."_
- _"Extract all email addresses from this page and copy them"_
- _"Log in to my account and download the latest invoice"_

## Best Models for Agent Mode

| Model                  | Notes                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Lilim**              | Default on Lilith Linux — purpose-built for this |
| **Claude Opus/Sonnet** | Best among cloud models                          |
| **GPT-4o**             | Good all-rounder                                 |
| **Gemini Flash**       | Fast for simpler tasks                           |

<Warning>
  Most local models (Ollama, LM Studio) struggle with complex multi-step agent
  tasks unless you're using Lilim, which is specifically optimized for Posessed
  Browser.
</Warning>

## How the Agent Works

The agent uses a loop of perception, reasoning, and action:

1. **Perceive** — The agent reads the current page structure
2. **Reason** — The AI (Lilim or your chosen model) decides the next action
3. **Act** — The agent clicks, types, or navigates
4. **Repeat** — Until the task is complete or it needs your input

The agent operates inside your browser, with no remote screen capture or cloud relay.
