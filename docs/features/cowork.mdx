# Cowork

Cowork lets you combine web browsing automation with local file operations. Research the web and save the results to a folder — all in one agent task.

## What Cowork Enables

- Research a topic online and write a report to `~/Documents/`
- Scrape data from multiple pages and export as a CSV
- Download files from web sources, process them, and save locally
- Fill out forms using data from a local file

## Using Cowork

1. Open the **Assistant** panel
2. Describe a task that involves both the web and your filesystem:
   _"Search Hacker News for AI news today, compile a summary, and save it to ~/Desktop/ai-briefing.md"_
3. The agent will handle both sides — browser actions and file writes

## On Lilith Linux

Cowork is particularly powerful on Lilith Linux because **[Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim)** has native awareness of your system. It can read from and write to your filesystem with the same ease as browsing the web.

<Info>
  Lilim's system integration will deepen with future releases of Lilith Linux —
  expect richer file management, terminal access, and inter-app automation.

## Privacy

All operations happen locally. No data is sent to any external service unless you're using a cloud AI provider that receives the page content as part of the prompt.
