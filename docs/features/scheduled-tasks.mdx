# Scheduled Tasks

Scheduled Tasks let you run any agent task automatically — daily, hourly, or every few minutes. Set it up once and let Posessed Browser handle it on autopilot.

## Setting Up a Scheduled Task

1. Open the **Assistant** panel (click the toolbar button or press `Ctrl+B`)
2. Go to **Scheduled Tasks** in the sidebar
3. Click **New Task**
4. Write your agent prompt
5. Set your schedule (interval or cron-style)
6. Enable and save

## Example Use Cases

- **Daily briefing** — _"Go to my favorite news sites and summarize the top 5 stories"_
- **Price monitoring** — _"Check whether this product is under $50 on Amazon"_
- **Form submissions** — _"Fill and submit my weekly timesheet"_
- **Data collection** — _"Extract today's metrics from my analytics dashboard and save to a file"_

## How It Works

The agent runs in the background using the same AI engine as Agent Mode. On Lilith Linux, this is **[Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim)** — running locally, no cloud required.

## Notes

- Tasks run only while the browser is open
- Results are saved to Agent History and optionally to a local file (via [Cowork](/features/cowork))
- Complex tasks work best with Lilim or a capable cloud model
