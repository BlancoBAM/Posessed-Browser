# LLM Chat Hub

The LLM Chat Hub lets you chat with multiple AI models simultaneously — compare their responses side-by-side directly within your browser.

## How to Use

1. Click the **Hub** icon in the toolbar
2. Select two or more AI providers to compare
3. Type your prompt once and see all responses simultaneously

## Use Cases

- Compare Claude vs Gemini vs GPT-4o on the same question
- Find which model gives the best answer for your specific task
- Test prompts across providers before committing to one

## Supported Providers

All providers configured in your **Settings → AI Provider** are available in the Hub:

- **Lilim** (on Lilith Linux — local, no cost)
- Ollama / LM Studio (local)
- Claude, OpenAI, Gemini (cloud, requires API key)
- Any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

## Tips

- Use Chat Hub to find which model works best for your use case, then set that as your default
- For Lilith Linux users, compare Lilim against cloud models to gauge how it performs on your specific tasks — as Lilim improves, you may be able to drop your cloud subscriptions entirely
