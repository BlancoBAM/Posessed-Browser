# Contributing to Posessed Browser

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Posessed Browser is the default browser for [Lilith Linux](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilith-Linux) and is powered by the [Lilim AI system](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim).

The project has two main areas:

- **Agent** — AI features, UI, and browser automation (`TypeScript/React`)
- **Browser** — The custom Chromium build (`C++/Python`)

- [Report Issues](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser/issues)

## Ways to Contribute

**Report bugs** — [Open an issue](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser/issues/new) with steps to reproduce and expected vs actual behavior.

**Suggest features** — Share ideas on [GitHub](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser/issues).

**Improve docs** — Docs live in `docs/` and use Mintlify. Edit pages and update `docs/docs.json` for navigation changes.

**Improve Lilim integration** — For AI improvements, consider contributing to [Lilim](https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Lilim) directly.

## Path 1: Agent Development

The agent is a Chrome extension monorepo with 3 components:

| Component      | Path                  | What it does                                             |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Agent UI**   | `apps/agent`          | Chrome extension — chat interface, settings, side panel  |
| **Server**     | `apps/server`         | Bun server — agent loop, MCP tools, API endpoints        |
| **Controller** | `apps/controller-ext` | Chrome extension — bridges `chrome.*` APIs to the server |

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/BlancoBAM/Posessed-Browser.git
cd Posessed-Browser/packages/browseros-agent

# Install dependencies
bun install

# Copy environment files
cp apps/server/.env.example apps/server/.env.development
cp apps/agent/.env.example apps/agent/.env.development
```

### Running Locally

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start the server
bun run start:server

# Terminal 2: Start the agent extension (dev mode)
bun run start:agent
```

Load the extension in Posessed Browser:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable **Developer mode**
3. Click **Load unpacked** → select `apps/agent/dist/`

## Path 2: Browser Development

Only needed if you're working on Chromium-level changes (patches, build system, platform features).

**Requirements:**

- ~100GB disk space
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- 3+ hours for first build

### Build Instructions

**1. Checkout Chromium source**

Follow the official [Chromium: Get the Code](https://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/get-the-code/) guide.

**2. Install UV and dependencies**

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
cd packages/browseros
uv sync
```

**3. Build**

```bash
uv run browseros build \
  --chromium-src <your-chromium-src-path> \
  --setup --prep --build \
  --build-type debug
```

After first build, incremental builds only need `--build`:

```bash
uv run browseros build --chromium-src <path> --build --build-type debug
```

## Making a Pull Request

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Create a branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Make changes** and test them
4. **Commit**: `git commit -m "feat: your change"`
5. **Push**: `git push origin feature/your-feature`
6. **Open a PR** with a clear description linking any related issues

## Code Standards

**TypeScript:**

- Strict typing — avoid `any`
- Zod schemas instead of raw TypeScript interfaces
- Path aliases (`@/lib`) over relative paths (`../`)

**React:**

- Tailwind CSS only
- Hooks at top level only
- Test with Vitest

**General:**

- Functions under 20 lines
- Test new features
- Handle errors gracefully
