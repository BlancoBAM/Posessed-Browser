# n8n Integration

[n8n](https://n8n.io) is an open-source workflow automation platform. You can connect Posessed Browser to n8n to trigger browser automation from your n8n workflows.

## Setup

1. Start your n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
2. In Posessed Browser, go to **Settings → App Connector → n8n**
3. Enter your n8n instance URL and API key
4. Create a workflow in n8n using the Posessed Browser node

## What This Enables

- Trigger agent tasks from n8n workflows
- Use browser data as inputs to n8n automation chains
- Chain browser scraping with other n8n integrations (databases, APIs, email, etc.)

## Example Workflow

```
Webhook trigger → Posessed Browser (scrape competitor pricing) → Google Sheets (log results) → Email notification
```

## On Lilith Linux

n8n can be self-hosted on Lilith Linux alongside Posessed Browser and Lilim, creating a fully local automation stack — no cloud services required.

For self-hosted n8n setup, see the [n8n documentation](https://docs.n8n.io/hosting/).
