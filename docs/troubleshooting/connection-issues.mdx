# Connection Issues

## AI Assistant Not Responding

**If you're on Lilith Linux:**

Check that the Lilim service is running:

```bash
systemctl status lilim
# If stopped:
systemctl start lilim
```

**If you're using another provider:**

- Verify your API key is correct in **Settings → AI Provider**
- Check that you have a working internet connection
- Try switching to a different provider temporarily

## MCP Server Connection Drops

The MCP server port may change across browser restarts. To fix:

1. Go to **Settings → App Connector**
2. Note the current MCP port shown
3. Update your MCP client config to use the new port

If the issue persists, toggling the MCP server off and on in settings forces a stable port assignment.

## Agent Not Taking Actions

If the agent responds but doesn't click or navigate:

1. Make sure the **Controller Extension** is installed and enabled (`chrome://extensions/`)
2. Try reloading the extension
3. For Lilim users: verify the Lilim server is accessible at the configured port

## Slow Agent Responses

- **Lilim**: Check system resource usage — Lilim runs locally and needs available CPU/RAM
- **Cloud providers**: Check your API rate limits and plan tier
- **Ollama**: Pull a smaller model for faster inference (`ollama pull mistral` instead of larger variants)
